# A Starter Dev Blog

Welcome to a starter blog for developers. I included all basics to make sure you are ready to post in no time. 

## Config
Be sure to check out [`config.js`](./config.js) to customize the look of the website, and provide some basic info. Simply edit the values you want.

Prior to running any npm script, the code over at [`generateStyles.js`](./generateStyles.js) will run, generating the scss variables.

scss is a superset of css. Any valid css will be valid scss.

## Styling
The main styles are over at [`styles.scss`](./src/styles/styles.scss)

## Deployment
To deploy the site, follow the guide at [https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/)
