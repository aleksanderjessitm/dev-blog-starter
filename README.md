This repository is meant to serve as a quick start into the world of blogging.

It includes a basic SEO setup, and a basic blogging setup. Nothing too fancy, though it will work.

## Config

If you look over at [blogConfig](./blogConfig.js), you will see that I made configuration super easy.

Just change some values, and you are all set.

## Deployment

You deploy the site by installing Vercel's CLI:
`npm install -g vercel`

and then running:
`vercel --prod`.

Just follow the instructions and you are set.

_What follows is a standard `create-next-app` `Readme`. I am leaving it here for all of you who might not know how Next.js works._

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
